# Peter's personal ZMK keyboard firmware

For the following keyboards:

* [Gamma Omega TC36K](https://github.com/unspecworks/gamma-omega/tree/main/tc36k),
  using my basic [ZMK firmware for TC36K](https://github.com/peterjc/zmk-keyboard-graph-theory/tree/main/boards/shields/tc36k)

The base layer is based on the inverted [Hands Down Promethium
layout](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1g66ivi/hands_down_promethium_snth_meets_hd_silverengram/)
with my personal modifications ("Pico Mod") intended to help with some readline shortcuts.
Most of the symbols are 2-key vertical combos. There is a single combined
numbers and navigation layer accessed by holding the right thumb. I wanted to
be able to use this on my laptop too - achieved with [custom Karabiner-Elements
rules](https://codeberg.org/peterjc/kana-chording-ke/src/branch/main/hands-down-on-jis-macbook)
(see this [blog post](https://blastedbio.blogspot.com/2025/05/what-have-you-done-to-your-keyboard.html)).
