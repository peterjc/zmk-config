# Peter's personal ZMK keyboard firmware

For the following keyboards:

* [Gamma Omega TC36K](https://github.com/unspecworks/gamma-omega/tree/main/tc36k),
  using my basic [ZMK firmware for TC36K](https://github.com/peterjc/zmk-keyboard-graph-theory/tree/main/boards/shields/tc36k)

The base layer is based on the inverted Hands Down Promethium layout with
my personal modifications intended to help with some readline shortcuts.
Most of the symbols are 2-key vertical combos. There is a single combined
numbers and navigation layer accessed by holding the right thumb.
